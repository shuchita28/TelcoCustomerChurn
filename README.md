# TelcoCustomerChurn
DS5220 Supervised Machine Learning project

## Abstract
Customer churn analysis helps us understand the journey a customer goes through on the service and the key areas where they fall off, which in turn helps us understand where we can improve our strategies and increase brand loyalty. This project proposes to predict the customer churn for a telecom company using predictive modeling.
Lost customers mean a direct loss of revenue which is why it is important to understand the reason behind customers leaving the company. Customer churn is the most important metric to evaluate the performance of a company. From the point of view of the company, it is necessary to gain this information because getting new customers is generally more tedious and costlier than retaining old customers.

## Introduction
Customer churn is the rate at which a business’s customers leave the company. For a telecom company like “Interconnect”, this makes a significant business impact directly affecting the profits. Focusing on long-term relationships and observing customer behavior is more cost- effective than the marketing campaigns to attract new customers. Customer churn is the percent of customers that stopped using a company’s services/product during a particular time.
It costs 25 times more to acquire a new customer as compared to retaining customers. This alone shows why tracking customer churn is so important. Also, the more we learn about customer behavior, the better understanding we’ll gain of the future expected revenue.

## Problem Statement
When I started this project, I planned to be able to predict the churn of clients for this company. Finally, through this project I analyzed the dataset and trained various ML classifier models to perform “Uplift Modeling” by targeting potential customers with the intention of reducing marketing costs while preserving the profit margins.
